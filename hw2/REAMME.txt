### What can it do? ###

* if you type history partyatjoes will print the last 10 commands to the screen
* you can run commands in the background by adding a & to the end of your command
* type exit to kill the shell

### How do I get set up? ###

* gcc partyatjoes.c
* ./a.out

# Current Bugs? ###
if you enter a char after !
such as !g
you will get a segmentation fault
to run a previous command by numner enter !and then the integer number of that command

when you enter &
the code runs in the backgroud and will not give you a command prompt again untill you hit enter for a second time.
the command is valid, but will print invalid command becuase it is not an standard execvp unix command

this is a standard output when you enter &
